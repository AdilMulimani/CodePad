A beautiful, modern code editor with integrated terminal emulator built with GTK+ 3 and VTE terminal library.

##  Motivation

CodePad was born out of boredom during my first year, second semester at university while enrolled in the **Data Structures in C** course. Initially, I was working on console-based projects like a train management system with menu-driven interfaces. However, I wanted to explore GUI development and create something more visually appealing and functional.

The idea struck me when I realized how often I was switching between my text editor and terminal while coding. Why not combine both into a single, elegant application? This project became my gateway into GUI programming with GTK+ and taught me valuable lessons about creating desktop applications in C.

What started as a learning exercise evolved into a fully-featured code editor.

## Technical Foundation

### GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit)
CodePad is built using **GTK+ 3**, a cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. GTK+ provides the foundation for our modern UI components, theming system, and event handling.

**Learn more about GTK+**: [GTK Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK)

### VTE (Virtual Terminal Emulator)
The integrated terminal functionality is powered by **VTE**, a terminal emulator widget for GTK+. VTE provides full terminal emulation capabilities, including:
- ANSI color support
- Shell integration
- Scrollback buffer
- Mouse interaction
- Copy/paste functionality
